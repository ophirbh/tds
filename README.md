Dear tester.

For this work I used an LLM for some code-writing assistance and for code remarks and organization.
I took into consideration your remarks to be less elaborative than in the first part.
I used a lot of utility code that is stored in one big cell, I encourgae you to navigate the part2 notebook using the project structure tab.
I hope you like it.
Thanks!
