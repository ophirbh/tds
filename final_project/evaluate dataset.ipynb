The second most frequent category being CUSHION is also plausible, followed by OVAL, PRINCESS, EMERALD, HEART, PEAR, and MARQUISE in decreasing order. Although MARQUISE is relatively small in number, it is not necessarily anomalous, as many diamond shapes can be less common in the marketplace. One possible consideration is whether additional shapes might have been expected (e.g., Radiant, Asscher), but their absence may simply reflect the data collection. No obvious anomalies arise, and these frequency counts are consistent with typical diamond shape availability and popularity trends.\n",

This pattern is in line with commercial availability and demand for mid-range clarity diamonds, while flawless diamonds (FL) and heavily included diamonds (I2, I3) indeed tend to be rare. Hence, the frequency distribution appears coherent and does not indicate major anomalies. The slight skew towards the more common clarity grades is expected in typical diamond datasets, and there do not appear to be any missing categories or suspiciously low frequencies beyond what is expected for rare grades.\n",

Additional categories such as K, L, M, N, and intentionally grouped ranges (O-P, Q-R, S-T, U-V, W-X, Y-Z) are also plausible diamond color classifications for less common stones. The presence of 'FANCY' as a separate category aligns with diamonds that do not fit the traditional color scale (e.g. fancy colored diamonds). The low counts (including 'O' and 'W' as single occurrences) could indicate rare or potential data entry anomalies, but they do not necessarily invalidate the distribution. There is no obvious indication of missing common categories. Hence, despite slightly skewed frequencies and a few extremely low counts, the distribution appears coherent for a diamond price prediction task.\n",

The dominant count of EX reflects that diamonds with higher cut quality are often more common in datasets, and the relatively smaller number of GD and especially F is plausible if fewer lower-grade diamonds were included or produced. However, there is potentially a missing “Premium” category that is commonly listed between Very Good and Excellent (EX). Other than that, the distribution does not show any major anomalies apart from the exceptionally low frequency for ‘F’, which might limit how well any model can learn about that segment. Overall, it is close to what one might expect in a diamond dataset, though if premium cuts were expected but not recorded, that would be a notable omission.\n",

However, the disparity is noticeable: ‘EX’ far outnumbers the other categories, and ‘F’ appears only twice. This could be due to limited observation of lower-quality polishes. While this skew may be completely reasonable given the market availability or acquisition bias of certain grades, it also suggests that the feature provides less representation in the mid-to-low categories (GD, F). Overall, there is nothing blatantly anomalous about the distribution, but it implies less reliable modeling for the two underrepresented categories.\n",

In practice, it is quite common for diamonds within a given dataset to cluster around higher-quality designations such as Very Good and Excellent, so it’s reasonable to see a relatively small count in Fair. The relative counts do not appear unusual or overly skewed, and no apparently missing standard category (like Poor) stands out in this dataset.

Although categories like ‘VSL’ and ‘SL’ are quite rare and may pose challenges for model training, there is no inherent anomaly in their presence.
